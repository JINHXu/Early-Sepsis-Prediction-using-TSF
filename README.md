## MIMIC-III Data

* [Database Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
* [How to get data](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/)
* [Application form](https://physionet.org/credential-application/)

## Keep some documentations on overleaf?

[Overleaf Link](https://www.overleaf.com/5363766881tqvnbdymqnfs) (Currently an ACL template)

_I also have a parser for `GitHub markdown` tables to `latex` tables conversion: [link](https://github.com/JINHXu/MDtable2Latex)_

## Problem Setup

Time Series Forecasting consistent with PhysioNet challenge?

> We ask participants to design and implement a working, open-source algorithm that can, based only on the clinical data provided, automatically identify a patient's risk of sepsis and make a positive or negative prediction of sepsis for every time interval.
