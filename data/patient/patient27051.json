Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

S shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Air within the bladder likely secondary to introduction from Foley\n catheter rather than emphysematous cystitis.  No renal stones or\n hydronephrosis.  Stable right renal cyst.\n\n 2.  Increased size of right greater than left pleural effusion and associated\n relaxation atelectasis.\n\n 3.  New small simple appearing fluid collection surronding the right\n pectoralis muscle.\n\n 4.  Increased destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive\n lymphoma.  There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\n secondary to lack of remaining osseous support.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No definite focal\n infiltrate is identified. There is stable atherosclerotic plaque within the\n aorta which is not opacified with contrast. A left internal jugular central\n venous catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC. Stable dense coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.  No pneumothorax is present. There is a stable\n noncalcified opacity within the left apex (2:11), measuring 8 mm and is\n stable, likely representing scar.  The major airways are patent down to the\n subsegmental level.  Although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast,\n there is no significant increase in axillary or mediastinal adenopathy with\n the largest right axillary lymph node measuring 9 mm.  There is increased\n anasarca and a new simple appearing fluid collection surrounding the right\n pectoralis musculature.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hypodense lesions within the\n liver are again noted despite lack of IV contrast.  The gallbladder is\n distended without pericholecystic fluid or appreciable wall thickening.  The\n spleen, pancreas, and large and small bowel are unremarkable.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

S shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Air within the bladder likely secondary to introduction from Foley\n catheter rather than emphysematous cystitis.  No renal stones or\n hydronephrosis.  Stable right renal cyst.\n\n 2.  Increased size of right greater than left pleural effusion and associated\n relaxation atelectasis.\n\n 3.  New small simple appearing fluid collection surronding the right\n pectoralis muscle.\n\n 4.  Increased destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive\n lymphoma.  There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\n secondary to lack of remaining osseous support.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No definite focal\n infiltrate is identified. There is stable atherosclerotic plaque within the\n aorta which is not opacified with contrast. A left internal jugular central\n venous catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC. Stable dense coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.  No pneumothorax is present. There is a stable\n noncalcified opacity within the left apex (2:11), measuring 8 mm and is\n stable, likely representing scar.  The major airways are patent down to the\n subsegmental level.  Although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast,\n there is no significant increase in axillary or mediastinal adenopathy with\n the largest right axillary lymph node measuring 9 mm.  There is increased\n anasarca and a new simple appearing fluid collection surrounding the right\n pectoralis musculature.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hypodense lesions within the\n liver are again noted despite lack of IV contrast.  The gallbladder is\n distended without pericholecystic fluid or appreciable wall thickening.  The\n spleen, pancreas, and large and small bowel are unremarkable.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

S shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Air within the bladder likely secondary to introduction from Foley\n catheter rather than emphysematous cystitis.  No renal stones or\n hydronephrosis.  Stable right renal cyst.\n\n 2.  Increased size of right greater than left pleural effusion and associated\n relaxation atelectasis.\n\n 3.  New small simple appearing fluid collection surronding the right\n pectoralis muscle.\n\n 4.  Increased destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive\n lymphoma.  There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\n secondary to lack of remaining osseous support.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No definite focal\n infiltrate is identified. There is stable atherosclerotic plaque within the\n aorta which is not opacified with contrast. A left internal jugular central\n venous catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC. Stable dense coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.  No pneumothorax is present. There is a stable\n noncalcified opacity within the left apex (2:11), measuring 8 mm and is\n stable, likely representing scar.  The major airways are patent down to the\n subsegmental level.  Although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast,\n there is no significant increase in axillary or mediastinal adenopathy with\n the largest right axillary lymph node measuring 9 mm.  There is increased\n anasarca and a new simple appearing fluid collection surrounding the right\n pectoralis musculature.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hypodense lesions within the\n liver are again noted despite lack of IV contrast.  The gallbladder is\n distended without pericholecystic fluid or appreciable wall thickening.  The\n spleen, pancreas, and large and small bowel are unremarkable.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

S shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Air within the bladder likely secondary to introduction from Foley\n catheter rather than emphysematous cystitis.  No renal stones or\n hydronephrosis.  Stable right renal cyst.\n\n 2.  Increased size of right greater than left pleural effusion and associated\n relaxation atelectasis.\n\n 3.  New small simple appearing fluid collection surronding the right\n pectoralis muscle.\n\n 4.  Increased destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive\n lymphoma.  There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\n secondary to lack of remaining osseous support.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No definite focal\n infiltrate is identified. There is stable atherosclerotic plaque within the\n aorta which is not opacified with contrast. A left internal jugular central\n venous catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC. Stable dense coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.  No pneumothorax is present. There is a stable\n noncalcified opacity within the left apex (2:11), measuring 8 mm and is\n stable, likely representing scar.  The major airways are patent down to the\n subsegmental level.  Although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast,\n there is no significant increase in axillary or mediastinal adenopathy with\n the largest right axillary lymph node measuring 9 mm.  There is increased\n anasarca and a new simple appearing fluid collection surrounding the right\n pectoralis musculature.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hypodense lesions within the\n liver are again noted despite lack of IV contrast.  The gallbladder is\n distended without pericholecystic fluid or appreciable wall thickening.  The\n spleen, pancreas, and large and small bowel are unremarkable.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],\n the attending radiologist, was present and supervising.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial\n vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.\n Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after\n establishing intravenous access.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

S shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Air within the bladder likely secondary to introduction from Foley\n catheter rather than emphysematous cystitis.  No renal stones or\n hydronephrosis.  Stable right renal cyst.\n\n 2.  Increased size of right greater than left pleural effusion and associated\n relaxation atelectasis.\n\n 3.  New small simple appearing fluid collection surronding the right\n pectoralis muscle.\n\n 4.  Increased destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive\n lymphoma.  There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\n secondary to lack of remaining osseous support.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile\n dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

No definite focal\n infiltrate is identified. There is stable atherosclerotic plaque within the\n aorta which is not opacified with contrast. A left internal jugular central\n venous catheter tip terminates in the distal SVC. Stable dense coronary artery\n calcifications are again noted.  No pneumothorax is present. There is a stable\n noncalcified opacity within the left apex (2:11), measuring 8 mm and is\n stable, likely representing scar.  The major airways are patent down to the\n subsegmental level.  Although difficult to evaluate given lack of IV contrast,\n there is no significant increase in axillary or mediastinal adenopathy with\n the largest right axillary lymph node measuring 9 mm.  There is increased\n anasarca and a new simple appearing fluid collection surrounding the right\n pectoralis musculature.\n\n CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Multiple hypodense lesions within the\n liver are again noted despite lack of IV contrast.  The gallbladder is\n distended without pericholecystic fluid or appreciable wall thickening.  The\n spleen, pancreas, and large and small bowel are unremarkable.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by\n fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were\n then removed.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Routine PA and lateral films are\nrecommended for evaluation when feasible.\n\n[**1-10**].  Echo.\nThe left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is\nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses\nare normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There\nis no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic\nmitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is\nmoderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n\nBased on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, attempts were\n made to advance the guidewire into the SVC.  The guidewire would not advance\n past the axillary vein and therefore a peel-away sheath was placed and a\n venogram performed demonstrating a short, tight stenosis at the right\n axillary/ subclavian vein junction.\n\n The area of stenosis was traversed under fluoroscopic guidance using a 0.018\n Glidewire.  A repeat venogram demonstrated a small amount of extravasated\n extraluminal contrast; however, the Glidewire was subsequently successfully\n navigated into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC line measuring 43 cm in length\n was then placed through the peel-away sheath with tip positioned in the SVC\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit.

A 7-day course of\nmetronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.\nDiff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,\nalthough all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and\nwas transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of\ntransfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,\nthrombocytopenia and anemia.\n\nOn the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib\nwith RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as\nrespiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.\nThere was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she\nhad pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt\ndigoxin was not recommended.\n\nPt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.

Clinical\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on\nclinical and echocardiographic data.\n\nCompared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable\nfor review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially\nadmitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with\nhypotension and AFib with RVR.\n\n# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with\nmany family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the\npatient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU\ntransfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the\npatient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].\nShe was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a\ndecision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.\n Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].\nThe family declined autopsy.\n\n# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to\n150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous\nconversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses\nand bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin\nconsidered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was\nstarted on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When\nthe patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having\nincreased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.\n\n\n# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and\nthrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be\nsecondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused\ntotal of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])\nwith a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend\nplatelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.\nTransfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the\npatient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total\nof four units since [**2194-1-12**]).\n\n# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having\nhypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to\nfluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV\nrelaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for\ndistributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was\nstarted on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was\nagain hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary\nto systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a\ndecision was then made to not escalate care.\n\n# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious\nsources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions\nunder breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz\nstarted on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not\nobtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff\nneg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since\nadmission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been\ngetting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have\nnot been able to keep up her free water intake.\n\n# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline\non admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to\ninfection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after\nresolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.\nThyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick\neuthyroid syndrome.\n\n# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient\ndeveloped labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for\nhypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide\ngtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated\nrespiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a\nwitnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While\nin the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had\nincreasing O2 requirements.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on\nadmission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of\n0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due\nto sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was\nhypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought\nsecondary to ATN.\n\n# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg\nIV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home\ndose 1/4.\n\n# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural\neffusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low\nalbumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.\nDiuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed\nabove.  Continue to monitor.\n\n# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis\nrequiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were\npositive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin\nand ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,\nwhich was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew\nout yeast.\n\n# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right\nacetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.\nThere is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head\nsecondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable\ndestruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and\nsurrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain\nis being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.\n\n# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to\nagressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and\nhypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese\nin MICU due to development of hypotension in response to\nfurosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],\nunchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.\n\n# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no\ninterventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration\ncausing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic\ncount and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per\noncology.\n\n# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.\nEncourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications on Admission:\n1.
