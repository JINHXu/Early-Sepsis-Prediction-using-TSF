inhibitor and BB. On the second day on the floor, he became
hypotensive and developed a fever to 102.5. He was given fluids
and placed on Dopamine out of concern for sepsis and possible
cardiogenic shock, and transferred back to the CCU. Over that
night he was switched to Levophed as he was too tachycardic on
Dopamine. A swan was again placed and the numbers were
consistent with cardiogenic shock and superimposed sepsis.
Pressors were changed to Milrinone.

B).  Respiratory Failure:  This is most likely secondary to
volume overload from end stage heart failure. The patient was
intubated for severe respiratory distress with tachypnea to 60s,
SaO2 of 80% on NRB and ABG of 7.4/34/43 on NRB. The patient
remained tachypneic and was overbreathing the vent, possibly due
to the sepsis or other metabolic derangement. The sedation was
increased sequentially in attempts to better control his
respiratory status.  He was unable to be extubated prior to
expiration.

   The pt spiked a temperature to 101 again on [**2107-3-1**] (3days
post intubation) at which point he was started on vancomycine
for presumed MRSA VAP.  Gram positive cocci were found in the
sputum gram stain. On day 4 of intubation, the patient spiked a
temperture to 104 and ultimately reuquired a cooling blanket and
around the clock tylenol to defervese. The patient was started
on levofloxacin and flagyl in addition to the vancomycin.  He
subsequently dropped his pressures requiring inc. doses of
levophed suggesting he was in severe sepsis.  A repeat sputum
gram stain showed gram postivie cocci as well as gram negative
rods suggesting the causative organism were most likely MRSA and
pseudomonas.  Antibiotics were continued, however he expired
from overwhelming sepsis and multi organ failure refractory to
two max dose pressors.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo lady w/ severe COPD, non operable lung CA
s/p bronch with gold seed placement admitted with respiratory
failure and septic shock.

# Septic Shock: Patient initially met criteria with elevated
WBC, tachypnea with hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.
Central line placed was performed in the ED. Empiric antibiotic
coverage for post-obstructive PNA initiated with Unasyn and
Vancomycin given recent bronchoscopy and high risk for mixed
flora/anaerobes. Patient received a total of 5 units of NS in
the ED with continued fluid resuscitation in the ICU as per the
sepsis protocol. CVP was maintain between [**6-29**], MAP >65 and SvO2
>70 with continuous monitoring. Levophed drip was started to
meet the above criteria which was weaned after stabilization of
her BP after approximately 48 hrs. IV fluid boluses were
continued with Lactated Ringers due to rising lactic acidosis.
Patient had a cortisol stim test which showed abnormal and
paradoxical results but was ultimately started on steroids due
to severe COPD. The patient was adequately fluid resuscitated
and weaned off pressors. She later became hypertensive and was
diuresed due to the large amount of fluids she initially
received for resuscitation. She remained stable in terms of her
likely pulmonary infection with her limitations being her
dependence on the ventilator due to COPD and underlying lung CA.

# Hypertension- Patient with episodes of tachycardia and
hypertension thought to be anxiety attacks with response to
Ativan/Seroquel. On [**8-10**] patient developed sustained
hypertension after another episode of anxiety with SBP >230.
Patient had been off all antihypertensives until this point due
to initial sepsis with hypotension. Patient had been taking an
ACE inhibitor at home, which was restarted, Captopril 6.25 mg
titrated as necessary for elevated BP.  On [**8-16**], she has another
episode of tachycardia to 110s and hypertension to 220s systolic
in the setting of hypoxia secondary to being on a spontaneous
breathing trial PS 0/5 for 45 minutes.  She blood pressure and
heart rate improved with light sedation with propofol

be from orthostasis.He was found to be anemic and workup
revealed duodenal ulcer(cauterised and injected) and GI
bleeding. He was also found to have MRSA pneumonia for which he
was started on levofloxacin and then converted to nafcillin for
which he completed 14d course on [**2135-11-20**]. He also had pleural
effusion which was tapped and found to have reaccumulated. No
further treatment was deemed necessary at that time.
He also tested positive for clostridium difficile. He will
continue on flagyl for 2 weeks after the completion of his other
antibiotics. Hypertension was a problem when his sepsis

thought secondary to underlying  sepsis [**1-19**] PNA aspiration vs.
MSSA PNA. The patient was placed on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for empiric
coverage of GP/GN/anerobes. He was febrile on admission, but
afebrile throughout remainder of ICU stay. Blood cx drawn on
admission and on follow up were negative. Of note, RSV antigen
was detected in his sputum. The patient's antibiotics were
continued until extubation and then discontinued.  Pt continued
to improve and follow up chest X ray showed on [**2128-11-20**] showed no
new lung lesions.  Pt was maintained off antibiotics and did not
worsen from a respiratory standpoint.

3. Sepsis: Hypotension likely related to septic shock on
admission. Patient initially received 4 L of IVF in the ED and 2
L of IVF after arrival to the MICU. He initially required
pressure support with Levophed, but this was weaned off within
the first 24 hours. An ECHO was performed which showed no
evidence of pericardial effusion, a normal LA, and an EF of
50-55%. He was bolused for low CVP throughout the first several
days of his hospital stay such that by [**11-12**] the patient was
over 13 L positive, but did not show any signs of peripheral
edema. The patient was thought to be profoundly intravascularly
depleted [**1-19**] sepsis, poor nutritional status and poor PO intake.

auto-diuresis with additional medication. Although he was
initially hypotensive, the patient's HR and BP slowly increased
such that his HR was in the 90's with SBP>150. He was started on
diltiazem which was quickly titrated to 120mg qid for heart rate
control.  As he improved clinically, the diltiazem was decreased
and pt was sent home on 60mg po qid.  Pt was somewhat
tachycardic to 110s on the floor, but this seemed to be more in
the immediate post-albuterol nebulizer setting, as well as due

134,2034.0,159872.0,2198-03-15,,"REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Sepsis, aspiration pneumonia.
A chest x-ray there showed likely aspiration pneumonia and
fingerstick glucose was noted to be 30 with an oxygen
saturation of 77% on room air.  He was given Zosyn, put on a
nonrebreather face mask and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].  At the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room he was placed into the sepsis protocol.

1.  Sepsis:  The patient was placed on a sepsis protocol with
a goal central venous pressure of [**9-13**].  Serial lactates
were monitored.  The patient was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  He was initially placed on Ceftriaxone,
vancomycin and Flagyl.  Levophed was titrated to a mean
arterial pressure greater than 60.  his Lasix, Aldactone and
propanolol were held.  Blood cultures (final report) showed
no evidence of bacteremia.  The septic shock was thought to
be secondary to aspiration pneumonia, although, the chest
x-ray was significant only for mild left lower lobe
atelectasis versus consolidation.  A paracentesis was
performed and was negative for SVP.  A urinalysis was
negative for urinary tract infection.  Stool cultures,
Clostridium difficile and sputum cultures are all negative at
the time of dictation. The Levophed was weaned off on [**3-10**].  The vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl were stopped on
[**3-11**].  The patient was maintained on levofloxacin and
Flagyl for a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.  His
Ciprofloxacin will be continued after this course has been
completed, just once a week q. Tuesday for SVP prophylaxis.

8.  Change in mental status:  It is most likely that the
patient's change in mental status is secondary to
hypoglycemia.  Other considerations would be delirium versus
medications versus sepsis.  He was maintained on lactulose
t.i.d. titrated to three bowel movements a day.  He does have
a history of hyperammonemia in the past, and his ammonia
level at the time of admission was 38.  Although, this is not
a very specific finding.

12.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition/metabolic acidosis:
Initially the patient had a primary metabolic acidosis likely
secondary to lactic acidosis secondary to septic shock with
compensatory respiratory alkalosis.  Following the resolution
of the patient's sepsis, he had a normal anion gap acidosis
likely secondary to aggressive fluid hydration as well as
diarrhea with a urine anion gap that was less than 12.",[**2198-3-9**]  ,,144.0

1) DKA:
Pt was started on insulin gtt and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  The
underlying etiology was her UTI and sepsis.  With treatment of
this and insulin gtt, her gap slowly closed.  She was
transitioned to SC insulin once the gap was closed.  After this,
her BG remained occassionally high over 200, so her lantus dose
was increased to 10U daily.  With this, BG was improved, though
further titration may be required as outpt for optimal control.

2) SEPSIS secondary to UTI:
Pt has a very large leukocytosis on admission which resolved
over the course of her stay.  Both the urine and blood cultures
grew pansensitive E.coli.  The patient was maintained on IV
ceftriaxone for about 6days.  Her blood cultures cleared right

Unit stay, the patient was noted to have increased sputum
production with a sputum culture positive for Acinetobacter.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient became hemodynamically
unstable in the Emergency Department, with hypotension

left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 40%,
with no focal wall motion abnormalities.  The patient was
Swanned on hospital day number two, with indices consistent
with mixed sepsis and congestive heart failure (pulmonary
capillary wedge 17, with a cardiac output of 8).  The patient
was weaned off dopamine on hospital day number two, and
maintained a systolic blood pressure greater than 100

5.  Infectious Disease:  On admission, the patient was noted
to have right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates,

ceftriaxone) for presume aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
The patient's ceftriaxone was discontinued on hospital day
number two, however, levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued
on hospital day number nine, when they were discontinued for
presumed contribution to thrombocytopenia.  The patient
remained afebrile throughout the admission, with all blood

fevers getting up to 104.  Went to OSH where she was found to
have pus assoc with L scl portacath and xferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  In ED
initially looked very good, normotensive and with normal
lactate.  Slowly, and despite agreesive fluid resessition >5L
and the portacath being removed, she became increasingly
hypotensive and hyperglycemic, eventually meeting sepsis
criteria, being placed on levaphed and xygris.

164,3133.0,179884.0,2174-02-02,,"HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery Service and continued on  Zosyn and Fluconazole for
antibiotics.  The patient did well initially and the patient
continued to remain afebrile with stable vital signs.  On
hospital day #3, the patient had decrease in abdominal pain
and continued on Zosyn and Flagyl for antibiotics.  On
hospital day #6, the patient, however, spiked a fever to
101.7.  The patient was pancultured.  The patient underwent a
biliary drain study where the patient became a bit
tachycardiac.  Once the patient returned from the study, the
patient became febrile to 103.6 with blood pressures in the
130s.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
and was put on Zosyn and Vancomycin.  The patient's liver
function tests were elevated with AST of 111, alkaline
phosphatase 233, total bilirubin 3.2 and LDL of 47.  The
patient continued to spike a fever in the Intensive Care Unit
and was afforded antibiotics.  The patient's white count was
20.6.  Urine culture from [**12-14**], grew out nothing.
Bile culture showed no organisms. The patient was
hemodynamically unstable.  The patient therefore was
intubated in the Intensive Care Unit and was resuscitated
with intravenous fluids.  The patient also received red blood
cells, platelets and coags were also sent.  The patient was
diagnosed with biliary sepsis and was supported in the
Intensive Care Unit setting.  The patient continued to
improve in the Intensive Care Unit with the intravenous
antibiotics and intravenous fluids.  On the patient had a
lengthy Surgery Intensive Care Unit stay.  The patient's
hemodynamics were stabilized, although the patient was still
confused and tremulous.  The patient had been followed by
Psychiatry who felt that this was due most likely a delirium
due to multifactorial cause such as being in the Intensive
Care Unit for a length of time.  The cultures that grew from
the panculturing which showed a lesser sac fluid which was
positive for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.  Blood
cultures were cytomegalovirus positive.  The patient was put
on Ganciclovir, Linezolid and Levofloxacin in the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient's hepatitis C virus viral load was
less than 500,000 and Urology was also consulted about the
patient's mental status.  They also recommended limiting
Haldol and using self-restraints and there is no need for
electroencephalogram or imaging the head.  One thing was to
get the Infectious Disease input.  By Surgery Intensive Care
Unit day #27, the patient had slow improvement in his
encephalopathy and the patient was continued on antibiotics.
The patient ultimately had cytomegalovirus encephalitis,
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus positive culture from the
bile and thrombocytopenia.  By Surgery Intensive Care Unit
day #29, the patient was doing better and was on Lithium and
Haldol for agitation with his history of bipolar disease.
Throughout this the patient was on tube feeds to continue the
nutritional needs.  On Surgery Intensive Care Unit day #33,
the patient was moved to the floor in stable condition.  The
patient was seen by Swallow Study who felt that the patient
needed to be continued on the nasogastric tube feeds and to
advance the p.o. diet slowly.  If the mental status improves,
occupational therapy recommended extending rehabilitation.
The patient also has been followed by Psychiatry, continuing
not adding any antidepressants and continuing Lithium.  The
patient continued to improve throughout his stay.  The
patient remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
to evaluate the possibility of pancreatic duct disruption,
causing a leak which caused abdominal peripancreatic flow
collection.  The endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography showed normal pancreatic duct
without any evidence of extravasation. The biliary antrum was
patent and nasogastric tubes were in place.  Otherwise the
patient continued to do well.  The patient was continued on
[**3-31**] strength impact at a goal of 120 cc/hr for tube feeds.
On hospital day #53 the patient had no complaints remained
febrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's mental status
had returned to a functional level.  There was no cardiac
history, there were no pulmonary issues.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  The patient had a pigtail #2
that was still in place.  Drain #3 was discontinued.  The
patient's liver function tests were stabilized and the
patient was discharged to the rehabilitation facility.

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial picture was consistent with
septic + cardiogenic shock. Initial SG numbers revealed high
SVR, low CO, and high PCWP. He remained hypotensive despite IVF,
and pressors were continued, with eventual triple pressor
therapy (Levo, Dopamine and Vasopressin) required for
hemodynamic support. A random cortisol was 20, and 29
post-cosyntropin. Despite appropriate response, the low random
cortisol prompted initiation of steroid therapy, initially
Dexamethasone, then hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone with plan
to complete 7 days of Rx (completed). His lactate, elevated on
admission, came down. He was successfully weaned off Levo and
Vasopressin on [**2195-12-28**], then off Dopamine on [**2195-12-29**]. ERCP did
not show obstruction, ?biliary sludge.  He was initially on

discontinued on [**12-27**] (c. diff neg x 3), and he will continue a
course of cipro for ?urosepsis.  All cultures here have been
NGTD, but he is being treated for [**4-26**] E. coli blood culture

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old gentleman who had a kidney transplant
many years ago. He was admitted to an outside hospital with
intra-abdominal sepsis
and was taken to the operating room for a sigmoid resection and
colostomy. One week after that procedure, the patient was

On arrival, he was found to be hypotensive and febrile, with an
hematocrit of 20 and a platelet count of 33. He was medically
maximized during the first initial hour and prepared for the
operating room, to repair what was obviously a fascial
dehiscence and a necrotic stoma and possible intra-abdominal
sepsis. After a long discussion with the brother about the
critical nature of his care, his brother (his health care proxy)

staph aureus.  A urine culture grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] but no
significant bacteria.  Thus the vancomycin was continued and
cefepime discontinued on hospital day 3.  Her suprapubic
catheter was changed in the ICU.
   Infectious disease was consulted for treatment
recommendations.  They agreed that sacral decubitus ulcer was
the likely source for bacteremia and recommended MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**]
for sacral osteomyelitis as well as TTE to [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for valvular
vegetations.  Blood cultures were followed serially.  The
echocardiogram, as above, was negative for endocarditis.  Three
subsequent blood cultures grew out MRSA; the last was on [**11-10**].
Vancomycin was continued.  Surveillance cultures were followed
through [**11-14**] and all returned negative.  Once therapeutic on
vancomycin, she defervesced and her white count returned to
[**Location 213**].
   She will need to complete a six-week course of vancomycin

   Shortly after admission, the pt was found to have an IMI;
however, based on the history, ECG & cardiac enzymes the timing
of the pt's MI was unclear, possibly having occured >12-24 hours
prior.  Thus, the patient was not re-vascularized at that time.
Medical management for his MI was provided with heparin gtt,
aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin. (Of note, the atorvastatin
was later discontinued because of increasingly elevated LFTs
while on it). Plans for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization
were started.  However, because of deterioration in the

The pt underwent a left and right heart catheterization on

involving the left anterior descending, left circumflex, and
right coronary artery.  Because of the patient's condition (he
was febrile and volume overloaded), CT surgery felt that the
risk of performing CABG at that time was too high.  Thus, the pt
underwent stenting (with drug eluting stents) of the presumed
culprit vessel, the left circumflex.  Plans for stenting of the

puncture the patient missed the window for Xigris therapy.
The patient was given a seven day course of Hydrocortisone
and Flutricortisone for relative adrenal insufficiency.  He
was kept on low dose fluids and remained normotensive and
hemodynamically stable throughout his MICU stay.

started on tube feeds which he tolerated at goal.  His
electrolytes were monitored and repleted as needed.  The
patient was noted to have a metabolic acidosis on admission
to the MICU, likely secondary to septic shock and
overwhelming Streptococcal septicemia.  In addition, the
patient was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis likely
