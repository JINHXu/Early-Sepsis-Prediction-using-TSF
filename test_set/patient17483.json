Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was present for the\n procedure.\n\n The left upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped.  As no superficial\n veins were visible, ultrasound was used to localize the left brachial vein.\n Ultrasound guidance after local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge\n needle was used to access the vein.  Under fluoroscopic observation, a .018\n guide wire was advanced into the superior vena cava.  A 5-French sheath and\n dilator were placed over the wire, and through the introducer a 5-French dual-\n lumen 37-cm PICC line was advanced into the superior vena cava.  A sterile\n dressing was applied and post-procedure radiograph obtained.\n\n MEDICATIONS:  Local anesthesia consisted of 1% lidocaine.\n\n COMPLICATIONS:  No complications were evident.\n\n FINDINGS:  Son[**Name (NI) 796**] demonstrated a patent brachial vein, no basilic vein was\n seen.

See previous notes for her full course here. In brief, she was treated with fluids and pressors for low BPs and given abx for a presumed Crohn's flare-up, then transferred to the floor [**2147-6-27**] after stabilization. On [**2147-6-29**], she again became hypotensive to a SBP in the 50's (they were tolerating SBPs in the 70-80's as long as she continued to produce urine and mentate at baseline) and less responsive. She received 3 boluses, 500 cc x 2 and 250 cc x 1, with little effect. MDs initiated a discussion with the pt.'s family re: plan of care given her code status (DNR/DNI) and the family expressed a wish that she be treated with pressors, fluid boluses and IV abx. At this point, she was transferred back to the MICU to be started on pressors for BP control.\n\nHistory/Social: see Functional Health Patterns sheet.\n\nAllergies: PCN\n\nReview of Systems:\n\nNeuro: pt. initially lethargic, moaning in response to questions, following commands, MAE.
