I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 85F HTN, Parkinson's, chronic pancreatitis,\n   chole, ampullary stenosis with prior sphincterotomy p/w 2d abd pain,\n   poor POs, vomiting but denies fever, rigors, change in bladder / bowel\n   function. Afebrile in ED with VS 130/70 90, labs notable for WBC 30K c\n   14% bands, elevated ALT/AST/bili; CT with pneumobilia. Started on\n   Unasyn, taken for urgent ERCP this PM given concern for cholangitis,\n   which was notable for CBD stone with pus - stent placed, stone remains\n   in CBD. ERCP team notes transient episode of desaturation during\n   procedure, resolved with time and supplemental oxygen.\n   Exam notable for Tm 100.7 BP 100/30 HR 67 RR with sat 97 on RA. Frail\n   woman, NAD. JVD flat. CTA B. RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. No edema. Labs notable\n   for WBC as above, HCT 40, K+ 3.2, Cr 1.1, lactate 4.3. CXR with clear\n   lungs, EKG NSR s sig STTW changes.\n   Agree with plan to manage acute cholangitis with obstructing CBD stone\n   with broad abx coverage with vanco / zosyn / flagyl while awaiting BCx\n   and continuing hydration based on MAP / UOP. Will need f/u ERCP for\n   stone extraction - hold ASA for now and maintain BBS. Will trend LFTs,\n   lactate, and WBCs, and will hold antihypertensives in the setting of\n   acute infection. Single episode of desaturation concerning for possible\n   aspiration, check CXR in AM and continue broad abx as above. Will\n   monitor FSG with RISS while in ICU; no prior hx DM but FSG >200 in the\n   ED in patient with chronic pancreatic disease. Will continue\n   Parkinson's and GERD meds at home doses.

In ED, Unasyn 3gm given and a right IJ central line was\nplaced. She underwent ERCP that showed 1-cm stone in the common\nbile duct.

On [**2-3**], she developed shortness of breath that\nimproved with administration of furosemide.  Nebulizer\ntreatments also given.  At time of transfer to floor, O2 sat was\n95% on 2L nasal canula.

The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to\nremove the stone.  Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli\nand Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source.  Patient initially\non Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to\nVanco and Cipro.  This was finally changed to ampicillin when\nsusceptibilities resulted.\n\n# Cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, AST\n979, ALT 723, AP 120, TB 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ERCP was\nperformed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. Her\nhemodynamics remained stable. Blood cultures were positive for\ngram negative rods, and she was treated with IV Zosyn.\nHepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis A exposure.\n She developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue\nantibiotics until [**2-16**].  She will need ERCP follow up in 1 month\nfor repeat ERCP and stent placement.\n\n# E. Coli and Enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to\nAmpicillin.  Pt initially on Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and\nCiprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia.

She was found\nto have restrictive filling pressures and elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**].\n She will be discharged on lasix 10mg daily until she sees her\nPMD.  She will need cardiology follow up given her disease.\n\n# Thrombocytopenia: PLTs decreased to 83 ([**2-3**]) from 182 on\nadmission. Pt not on heparin, thought to be [**12-21**] sepsis at\nadmission. Hemolysis labs not concerning for DIC, and less\nlikely thought to be due to ITP or TTP.
