His HCP says that he had a speech and swallow in the past\nand they recommended crushing his medications in apple sauce and\navoiding thin liquids. The patient has recently refused this and\nhas been taking thin liquids and coughing signficantly with\nthem. Today, his caregivers brought him to his PCPs office. They\ngot a CXR and labs. His sodium returned at 115 and his CXR\nsuggested aspiration pneumonia with bilateral basilar\ninfiltrates.

He received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED.\nAs sputum gram stain showed a mixture of different organisms, he\nwas started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with\nvancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.  Following his admission to the\nICU the patient continued to be in respiratory distress with\nepsidoes of tachypnia and tachycardia with a heart rate to the\n150??????s.  An EKG showed MAT.  His respiratory distress was\nconsistently improved with morphine.  It was felt that Mr.\n[**Known lastname 2852**] was unlikely to recover from his pneumonia given his\ninability to wean off bipap and to cough to clear his own\nsecretions.  As he was DNI status he could not be intubated to\nhave secretions suctioned out.  In addition, the patient\nappeared visibly uncomfortable on BiPAP and quickly desaturated\ninto the 70??????s without it.\n\nBecause the patient was given several liters of fluid for\nhyponatremia, there was the possibility that diuresis could\nimprove his oxygenation enough to enable him to wean off the\nbipap, however, this did not prove to be the case.  He was also\ngiven nebs prn.  Upon discussing the patient's poor prognosis\nwith his health care proxy the decision was made to make him\nCMO.  Antibiotics and BiPAP were withdrawn and the patient died\nshortly thereafter.\n\n#2 Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia, likely\nhypovolemic hyponatremia.  On admission he appeared dry and had\na history of poor PO intake, although he was mentating well.  He\nreceived 1000 ml NS boluses overnight with maintenance fluids.\nThe patient does have a history of low sodium but usually to the\n130 range, whereas his admission sodium was 115.  His sodium\nimproving slowly with IVF.\n\n#3 Hypertension: The patient's home regimen of atenolol was held\ngiven concern for possible sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.\nAspirin was continued.\n\n#4 Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Occurred in the setting of\nanxiety and tachypnea and improved with morphine.  Rate control\nwith a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker was held due to\nconcern for hypotension in the setting of an infection.\n\n#5 spinal fracture: The patient was in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar on\nadmission.  Per discussion with neurosurgery, the patient needed\nto wear the collar due to an unstable spinal fracture.  His\ncollar was removed when he was made CMO.\n\n#6 BPH with incontinence: The patient's home regimen of\noxybutynin was continued.\n\n#7 Macrocytic anemia: The patient usually has a macrocytic\nanemia and presented with a normal hematocrit, indicating that\nhe was quite volume depleted.  B12 supplementation was\ncontinued.\n\n# Osteoporosis: Calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax were continued.\n\n# Depression: Escitalopram was continued.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\ntylenol 1g TID\nalendronate 70mg qsunday\nasa EC 325mg daily\natenolol 25mg daily\ncolace\nflomax 0.4mg [**1-12**] after meal\nfolic acid 1mg daily\nlexapro 10mg daily\nmetamucil in AM\noxybutynin 5mg [**Hospital1 **]\nsenna qhs\ntrazodone 100mg qhs\ntums TID\nvit B12 1000mcg daily\nvit D 400 units [**Hospital1 **]\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nn/a, patient expired\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnoses:\nAspiration pneumonia\nRespiratory failure\nHyponatremia\n\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nNot applicable, patient expired\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPatient expired\n\n\n"}, "2118-12-03 03:06:00": {"lab_results": {"51237": {"value": "17", "value_uom": "mEq/L", "lab_names": ["Anion Gap", "Blood"]}, "51244": {"value": "NORMAL", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Platelet Smear", "Blood"]}, "51248": {"value": "NORMAL", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Poikilocytosis", "Blood"]}, "51249": {"value": "NORMAL", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Polychromasia", "Blood"]}, "51250": {"value": "12.9", "value_uom": "%", "lab_names": ["RDW", "Blood"]}, "51274": {"value": "3.31", "value_uom": "m/uL", "lab_names": ["Red Blood Cells", "Blood"]}, "51256": {"value": "16.4", "value_uom": "K/uL", "lab_names": ["White Blood Cells", "Blood"]}, "51265": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "mg/dL", "lab_names": ["Bilirubin", "Urine"]}, "51222": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Blood", "Urine"]}, "51275": {"value": "<1", "value_uom": "#/hpf", "lab_names": ["Epithelial Cells", "Urine"]}, "51277": {"value": "70", "value_uom": "mg/dL", "lab_names": ["Glucose", "Urine"]}, "51254": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "mg/dL", "lab_names": ["Ketone", "Urine"]}, "51221": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Leukocytes", "Urine"]}, "50868": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Nitrite", "Urine"]}, "51146": {"value": "7.0", "value_uom": "units", "lab_names": ["pH", "Urine"]}, "51006": {"value": "30", "value_uom": "mg/dL", "lab_names": ["Protein", "Urine"]}, "50983": {"value": "5", "value_uom": "#/hpf", "lab_names": ["RBC", "Urine"]}, "50971": {"value": "1.022", "value_uom": " ", "lab_names": ["Specific Gravity", "Urine"]}, "50970": {"value": "Clear", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Urine Appearance", "Urine"]}, "50963": {"value": "Yellow", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Urine Color", "Urine"]}, "50960": {"value": "RARE", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Urine Mucous", "Urine"]}, "50931": {"value": "NEG", "value_uom": "mg/dL", "lab_names": ["Urobilinogen", "Urine"]}, "50912": {"value": "1", "value_uom": "#/hpf", "lab_names": ["WBC", "Urine"]}, "50902": {"value": "NONE", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Yeast", "Urine"]}, "50893": {"value": "286", "value_uom": "K/uL", "lab_names": ["Platelet Count", "Blood"]}, "50882": {"value": "90", "value_uom": "%", "lab_names": ["Neutrophils", "Blood"]}, "51279": {"value": "NONE", "value_uom": "", "lab_names": ["Bacteria", "Urine"]}, "51200": {"value": "5", "value_uom": "%", "lab_names": ["Monocytes", "Blood"]}, "51301": {"value": "23", "value_uom": "mEq/L", "lab_names": ["Bicarbonate", "Blood"]}}}, "2118-12-03 04:44:00": {"text": "[**2118-12-3**] 4:44 AM\n CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 68251**]\n Reason: progression on pna\n Admitting Diagnosis: HYPONATREMIA\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n [**Hospital 3**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\n  80 year old man with aspiration pna, resp distress\n REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\n  progression on pna\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia, respiratory distress.\n\n CHEST:\n\n Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of [**12-2**].

Broad spectrum abx coverage\n   w/zosyn and flagyl. Patient in respiratory distress all day yesterday\n   and in the evening. Patient becomes tachypnic and Tachycardic with HR\n   to 150\n EKG shows MAT.  Distress consistently improves with 2mg\n   Morphine.  Unlikely to recover from pneumonia given inability to wean\n   off bipap and cough to clear own secretions and b/c of DNI status\n   cannot intubate and suction secretions out.  Patient visibly\n   uncomfortable on cpap, asked me to take mask off.  Last night patient\n   removed mask by self and desaturated into 70\ns.  Likely that patient\n   will fail cpap and preference would be to make him CMO before he\n   becomes even more uncomfortable.  Because he was given several liters\n   of fluid for Hyponatremia, possibility that diuresis may improve his\n   oxygenation enough to be able to take him off the bipap although this\n   is unlikely to result in significant improvement.\n   -continue vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia and\n   hospital associated pneumonia day #1 of abx = [**2118-12-1**]\n   -40mg Lasix IV x1, follow UOP, PO2\n   -2mg morphine prn for air hunger, anxiety\n   -HCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 777**] [**Name (NI) 2772**] (cousin) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2773**]) called and made aware of\n   situation, will be updated mid-day so that she can make travel plans\n   depending on patient\ns condition and response to diuresis.\n   -follow up blood and urine cultures and sputum culture\n   -pulmonary toilet\n   -nebs prn\n   - will likely need PEG in long term after acute exacerbation has passed\n   to reduce aspiration risk.\n   .\n   #2 hyponatremia: this is likely hypovolemic hyponatremia.
